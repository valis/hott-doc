\section{Simplicial categories with fibrations}

In this section, we will define a model structure on the category of simplicial categories with fibrations and prove that it is Quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial categories.

Let us establish some notation and terminology.
We will denote by $\sSet$ and $\sCat$ the categories of simplicial sets and simplicial categories, respectively.
We will denote by $N : \sCat \to \sSet$ the simplicial nerve functor.
A simplicial category is \emph{fibrant} if its simplicial $\Hom$-sets are Kan complexes.
A map of a simplicial category is an \emph{equivalence} if it becomes an isomorphism in the homotopy category.

We will say that a map $g : Y \to Z$ in a simplicial category $\C$ is a \emph{basic fibration} if, for every object $X$, the map of simplicial sets $g \circ - : \Hom(X,Y) \to \Hom(X,Z)$ is a Kan fibration.
For every object $Z$ of $\C$, we define a simplicial category $\C/Z$ as follows.
Its objects are basic fibrations $f : X \to Z$ and the simplicial set $\Hom_{\C/Z}(X,Y)$ of morphisms between $f : X \to Z$ and $g : Y \to Z$ is the following pullback:
\[ \xymatrix{ \Hom_{\C/Z}(X,Y) \ar[r] \ar[d] & \Hom_\C(X,Y) \ar[d]^{g \circ -} \\
              1 \ar[r]_-f                    & \Hom_\C(X,Z)
            } \]
The composition and identity maps are defined in the obvious way.
Since $g \circ -$ is a Kan fibration, $\Hom_{\C/Z}(X,Y)$ is a Kan complex, so $\C/Z$ is a fibrant simplicial category.
If $\C$ has enough basic fibrations, then $N(\C/Z)$ is equivalent to $N(\C)/Z$:

\begin{prop}[over-cat]
Let $\C$ be a fibrant simplicial category.
Suppose that every map of $\C$ factors into an equivalence followed by a basic fibration.
Then $N(\C/Z)$ is equivalent to $N(\C)/Z$ for every object $Z$ of $\C$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The proof of \cite[Lemma~6.1.3.13]{lurie-topos} applies in this setting.
\end{proof}

A \emph{simplicial category with fibrations} is a simplicial category which is equipped with a distinguished class of maps, called fibrations.
A morphism of simplicial categories with fibraions is a morphism of simplicial categories preserving fibrations.
The category of small simplicial categories with fibrations is finitely locally presentable since it is the category of models of a finitary essentially algebraic theory.
We will denote this category by $\sfCat$.

We will construct a left semi-model structure on the category of small simplicial categories with fibrations.
We will use the notation from \cite{hovey}.
We will work only with combinatorial (left) semi-model categories.
Thus, the following proposition will be useful:

\begin{prop}[semi-model-cat]
Let $\C$ be a category and let $\we$ be a class of morphisms of $\C$.
Then there is a combinatorial semi-model structure on $\C$ with $\we$ as a class of weak equivalences if and only if there are sets $\I$ and $\J$ of morphisms of $\C$ such that the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\we$ satisfies 2-out-of-3 and is closed under retracts.
\item $\Iinj \subseteq \we$.
\item $\J \subseteq \Icof$ and every map in $\Jcell$ with a domain which is an $\Icell$ complex belongs to $\we$.
\item $\Jinj \cap \we \subseteq \Iinj$.
\end{enumerate}
The class of cofibrations in this model category is $\Icof$ and the class of fibrations is $\Jinj$.
\end{prop}

This proposition implies that semi-model structures can be transferred:
\begin{prop}[semimodel-transfer]
Let $F : \C \to \D$ be functor between locally presentable categories with a right adjoint $U : \D \to \C$.
Suppose that there is a semi-model structure on $\C$ with $\we$ as the class of weak equivalences, $\I$ as a set of generating cofibrations, and $\J$ as a set of generating trivial cofibrations.
Then there is a semi-model structure on $\D$ with $U^{-1}(\we)$ as the class of weak equivalences, $F(\I)$ as a set of generating cofibrations, and $F(\J)$ as a set of generating trivial cofibrations
if and only if, for every map $f$ in $\Icell[F(\J)]$ with a domain which is an $\Icell[F(\I)]$ complex, the map $U(f)$ is a weak equivalence.
\end{prop}

Recall that the category of small simplicial categories is a combinatorial model category \cite[Proposition~A.3.2.4]{lurie-topos}.
The forgetful functor $U : \sfCat \to \sCat$ has both left and right adjoints.
Moreover, $U \circ (-)^\flat$ is isomorphic to $\Id$, where $(-)^\flat$ is the left adjoint of $U$.
It follows that the model structure on $\sCat$ can be transferred to $\sfCat$.
Moreover, $(-)^\flat \dashv U$ is a Quillen equivalence between $\sCat$ and $\sfCat$.

Let $\C$ be a combinatorial semi-model category with $\I$ and $\J$ as sets of generating cofibrations and generating trivial cofibrations, respectively.
Let $S$ be a set of maps of $\C$ such that maps in $\Icell[(\J \cup S)]$ with domains in $\Icell[(\I \cup S)]$ are weak equivalences.
Then \rprop{semi-model-cat} implies that $\I \cup S$ and $\J \cup S$ are sets of generating cofibrations and generating trivial cofibrations, respectively, for a semi-model structure on $\C$ with the same class of weak equivalences.
Moreover, the identity functor is a Quillen equivalence between the original model structure and the new one.

Let $[0]$ be the terminal simplicial category and let $[1]$ be the walking arrow considered as simplicial category with discrete simplicial $\Hom$-sets.
We will denote the domain object of $[1]$ by $b$ and its codomain object by $c$.
Let $[1]_f$ be the simplicial category with fibrations which has two objects and one non-identity map which is a fibration.
We will denote by $\gamma : [0] \to [1]_f$ the morphism that maps the unique object of $[0]$ to the codomain of $[1]_f$.

Let $[1]_e$ be any simplicial category with two objects $a$ and $b$ such that the map $[a,b] : [0] \amalg [0] \to [1]_e$ is a cofibration and $[1]_e \to [0]$ is a weak equivalence.
Consider the simplicial category with fibrations $[1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f$, where both morphisms $[0] \to [1]_f$ and $[0] \to [1]_e$ map the unique object of $[0]$ to $b$.
Let $\varphi : [1] \to [1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f$ be any morphism such that $\varphi(b) = a$ and $\varphi(c) = c$.
If $Z$ is a simplicial category with fibrations such that the underlying simplicial category is fibrant, then $Z$ has the right lifting property with respect to $\varphi$ if and only if every map factors into an equivalence followed by a fibration.

If $V$ is a simplicial set and $U$ is a simplicial subset of $V$, then we will denote by $[2]_{U,V}$ the simplicial category with fibrations that has three objects $0$, $1$, and $2$ such that
\[ \Hom_{[2]_{U,V}}(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    \varnothing & \quad \text{if } x > y \\
    \Delta^0    & \quad \text{if } x = y \\
    U           & \quad \text{if } x = 0, y = 1 \\
    \Delta^0    & \quad \text{if } x = 1, y = 2 \\
    V           & \quad \text{if } x = 0, y = 2
  \end{cases}
\]
The composition is defined in the obvious way.
The only fibration in $[2]_{U,V}$ is the unique map between $1$ and $2$.
Then we have the obvious maps $\lambda^n_k : [2]_{\Lambda^n_k,\Delta^n} \to [2]_{\Delta^n,\Delta^n}$.
A simplicial category with fibrations $Z$ has the right lifting property with respect to the maps $\lambda^n_k$ if and only if every fibration in $Z$ is a basic fibration.

\begin{prop}
There is a semi-model structure on the category of small simplicial categories with fibrations satisfying the following properties.
Weak equivalences are precisely the maps that are weak equivalences of the underlying simplicial categories.
Generating cofibrations are the generating cofibrations of simplicial categories together with the maps $\lambda^n_k$ and the map $\gamma$.
A simplicial category with fibrations $Z$ is fibrant if and only if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{it:fib-a} The underlying simplicial category of $Z$ is fibrant.
\item \label{it:fib-b} Every map in $Z$ factors into an equivalence followed by a fibration.
\item \label{it:fib-c} Every fibration in $Z$ is a basic fibration.
\end{enumerate}
Every fibration $p : \Hom(x,y)$ in a cofibrant simplicial category with fibrations is an epimorphism (that is, the map $- \circ p : \Hom(y,b) \to \Hom(x,b)$ is a monomorphism of simplicial sets for every object $b$).
The forgetful functor $U : \sfCat \to \sCat$ is a right Quillen functor and is a part of a Quillen equivalence.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $S = \{ \varphi \} \cup \{ \lambda^n_k \mid k \leq n, n \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
We will use $\I^\flat \cup S$ as a set of generating cofibrations.
Let us show that $\I^\flat \cup S$ generate the same class of cofibrations as $\I^\flat \cup S'$, where $S' = \{ \gamma \} \cup \{ \lambda^n_k \mid k \leq n, n \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
First, the map $\gamma$ is a cofibration since it is a retract of the cofibration $[0] \xrightarrow{\gamma} [1]_f \to [1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f$.
Let us show that the map $\varphi$ belongs to $\Icof[(\I^\flat \cup S')]$.
Consider the simplicial category with fibrations $C = ([1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f) \amalg_{[1]} D^2$,
where $[1] \to [1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f$ maps the non-identity map of $[1]$ to the equivalence and $D^2$ is the simplicial category with two objects $x$ and $y$,
two non-identity morphisms between $x$ and $y$ and one $1$-simplex between them.
Then the morphism $[1] \to C$ that maps $b$ to $a$ and $c$ to $c$ belongs to $\Icof[(\I^\flat \cup S')]$ and the morphism $[1] \to [1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f$ is a retract of $[1] \to C$.

A simplicial category with fibrations satisfies conditions \eqref{it:fib-a}-\eqref{it:fib-c} if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to $\J^\flat \cup S$.
Thus, we just need to show that maps in $\Icell[(\J^\flat \cup S)]$ with domains in $\Icell[(\I^\flat \cup S)]$ are weak equivalences (of simplicial categories).
Since weak equivalences are closed under transfinite composition, it is enough to prove that pushouts of maps in $S$ with domains in $\Icell[(\I^\flat \cup S)]$ are weak equivalences.

Let $h : \Hom_Z(a,c)$ be a map in a simplicial category with fibrations.
Let $\varphi' : Z \to Z'$ be the pushout of $\varphi$ along the map $[1] \to Z$ corresponding to $h$.
We need to show that $\varphi'$ is a weak equivalence.
The only object of $Z'$ that does not belong to $Z$ is $b$ and it is equivalent to $a$.
Thus, we just need to show that, for every pair of objects $x$ and $y$ of $Z$, the map $\Hom_Z(x,y) \to \Hom_{Z'}(\varphi'(x),\varphi'(y))$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets.
Note that $\varphi$ can be factored into maps $[1] \xrightarrow{\varphi_1} [1] \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f \xrightarrow{\varphi_2} [1]_e \amalg_{[0]} [1]_f$.
Let $\varphi_1'$ and $\varphi_2'$ be pushouts of $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$, respectively.
The map $\Hom_Z(x,y) \to \Hom(\varphi_1'(x),\varphi_1'(y))$ is an isomorphism.
The proof that the map $\Hom(\varphi_1'(x),\varphi_1'(y)) \to \Hom(\varphi_2'(x),\varphi_2'(y))$ is a weak equivalence is the same as in \cite[Proposition~A.3.2.4]{lurie-topos}.

Now, let us prove that every fibration $p : \Hom(x,y)$ in a cofibrant simplicial category with fibrations is an epimorphism.
It is enough to prove this for $\Icell[(\I^\flat \cup S)]$ complexes since every cofibrant simplicial category with fibrations is a retract of such a complex.
Let $Z$ be an $\Icell[(\I^\flat \cup S)]$ complex.
Then $Z = \colim_{\alpha < \lambda} Z_\alpha$, where $Z_\alpha \to Z_{\alpha + 1}$ is a pushout of a map in $\I^\flat \cup S$, $Z_0 = 0$, and $Z_\kappa = \colim_{\alpha < \kappa} Z_\alpha$.
We will prove by induction on $\lambda$ that, for every fibration $p : \Hom_Z(x,y)$ and every object $b$, the map $- \circ p : \Hom_Z(y,b) \to \Hom_Z(x,b)$ is a monomorphism.
This is obvious for $\lambda = 0$.
For limit ordinals, this follows from induction hypothesis.
If $\lambda = \alpha+1$, then $Z_\alpha \to Z_{\alpha+1}$ is a pushout of one of the generating cofibrations.
If it is a cofibration of the form $f^\flat$, then we can use the description of simplicial $\Hom$-sets of $Z_{\alpha+1}$ given in \cite[Proposition~A.3.2.4]{lurie-topos} to conclude that $- \circ p$ is a monomorphism.
If it is $\varphi$, then the description of simplicial $\Hom$-sets given above implies that $- \circ p$ is an isomorphism.
If it is $\lambda^n_k$, then simplicial $\Hom$-sets can be explicitly described in a similar way.
This description also implies $- \circ p$ is a monomorphism.

Finally, let $Z$ be a $\Icell[(\I^\flat \cup S)]$ complex and let $\lambda' : Z \to Z'$ be a pushout of a map $\lambda^n_k : [2]_{\Lambda^n_k,\Delta^n} \to [2]_{\Delta^n,\Delta^n}$.
Let $z$ be the image of $0$ and let $p : \Hom(x,y)$ be the image of the unique fibration in $[2]_{\Lambda^n_k,\Delta^n}$.
For every object $c$, we define a map of simplicial sets $f(c)$ as the pushout-product of $\Lambda^n_k \to \Delta^n$ and $- \circ p : \Hom_Z(y,c) \to \Hom(x,c)$.
Since $p$ is a fibration in a cofibrant simplicial category with fibrations, $- \circ p$ is a cofibration and $f(c)$ is a trivial cofibration.

Let $a$ and $b$ be a pair of objects of $Z$.
We define a sequence of trivial cofibrations of simplicial sets $f_i : N_i \to M_i$ as follows:
$f_0 = \id_{\Hom_Z(a,z)} \times f(b)$ and $f_{i+1}$ is the pushout-product of $f_i$ and $f(z)$.
We can also define maps $g_i : N_i \to \Hom_Z(a,b)$ such that $\varphi'_{a,b} : \Hom_Z(a,b) \to \Hom_{Z'}(\varphi'(a),\varphi'(b))$ is the pushout of $\coprod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} f_i$ along $[g_i]_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$.
Since $f_i$ are trivial cofibrations, $\varphi'_{a,b}$ is also a trivial cofibration.
Since $\varphi' : Z \to Z'$ is surjective on objects, this implies that it is a weak equivalence of simplicial categories.
\end{proof}

\section{Categories of marked objects}

Categories of marked objects were defined in \cite{marked-obj}.
Here, we recall their definition and basic properties.

\begin{defn}[marked-obj]
Let $\C$ be a category, let $\mathcal{K}$ be a small category, and let $\mathcal{F} : \mathcal{K} \to \C$ be a functor.
A \emph{$\K$-marked object} of $\C$ is a pair $(X,\mathcal{E})$, where $X$ is an object of $\C$ and $\mathcal{E} : \mathcal{K}^{op} \to \Set$ is a subfunctor of $\Hom(\mathcal{F}(-),X)$.
Morphisms $f : \mathcal{F}(K) \to X$ that belong to $\mathcal{E}$ will be called \emph{marked}.
A morphism of marked objects is a morphism of the underlying objects that preserves marked morphisms.
The category of marked objects will be denoted by $\C^m$.
\end{defn}

The forgetful functor $U : \C^m \to \C$ has a left adjoint $(-)^\flat : \C \to \C^m$ and a right adjoint $(-)^\sharp : \C \to \C^m$.
For every $X \in \C$, $X^\flat$ is the marked object in which no morphisms are marked (that is, $X^\flat = (X,\varnothing)$),
and $X^\sharp$ is the marked object in which all morphisms are marked (that is, $X^\sharp = (X,\coprod_{K \in \mathcal{K}} \Hom(K,X))$).
Objects of the form $X^\flat$ and of the form $X^\sharp$ will be called \emph{flat} and \emph{sharp} respectively.

\begin{thm}[mark-main]
Let $\C$ be a combinatorial model category and let $\mathcal{F} : \mathcal{K} \to \C$ be a functor such that, for every $K \in \mathcal{K}$, the object $\mathcal{F}(K)$ is cofibrant.
Then $\C^m$ is a combinatorial model category in which a map is a cofibration if and only if the underlying map is a cofibration in $\C$.
Both adjoint pairs $(-)^\flat \dashv U$ and $U \dashv (-)^\sharp$ are Quillen pairs.
If $\C$ is left proper, then so is $\C^m$.
A marked object $X$ is fibrant in $\C^m$ if and only if the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item The underlying object $U(X)$ is fibrant in $\C$
\item Marked maps in $X$ are stable under homotopy (that is, if two maps $K \to U(X)$ are homotopic and one of them is marked, then so is the other).
\end{itemize}
A map $f$ is a weak equivalence in $\C^m$ if and only if its underlying map is a weak equivalence in $\C$ and $R^m(f)$ reflects marked maps, where $R^m : \C^m \to \C^m$ is a fibrant replacement functor

A fibrant replacement functor $R^m$ can be defined as $X \mapsto (R(X),\mathcal{E})$,
where $R$ is a fibrant replacement functor for $\C$ and a map $K \to R(X)$ is marked in $R^m(X)$ if and only if
it is homotopic to a map that factors as a marked map $K \to X$ followed by the map $X \to R(X)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{remark}
This theorem also holds for left semi-model categories with one additional assumption that the domains of generating cofibrations are cofibrant.
This assumption is required for Jeff Smith's theorem for left semi-model categories.
\end{remark}

The model category of marked objects has an explicit description of mapping spaces:

\begin{lem}[marked-hom]
Let $X$ and $Y$ be a pair of marked objects and let $\mathrm{Map}(U(X),U(Y))$ be the mapping space in $\C$.
Then $\mathrm{Map}(X,Y)$ is a Kan subcomplex of $\mathrm{Map}(U(X),U(Y))$ consisting of those connected components in which one of the vertices correspond to a marked map $X \to Y$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By \cite[Lemma~3.4]{marked-obj}.
\end{proof}

We want to use the category of marked objects to described (non-full) $\infty$-subcategories of the $\infty$-category $\Ho_\infty(\C)$ corresponding to $\C$,
that is we want to find a model structure on $\C^m$ such that $\Ho_\infty(U) : \Ho_\infty(\C^m) \to \Ho_\infty(\C)$ is a monomorphism of $\infty$-categories.
A functor $U : \D \to \C$ between $\infty$-categories is a monomorphism if and only if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{it:mono-hom} For every pair of objects $x$ and $y$ of $\D$, the map $\Hom(x,y) \to \Hom(U(x),U(y))$ is a monomorphism of spaces.
\item \label{it:mono-eq} For every pair of objects $x$ and $y$ of $\D$ and every equivalence $e$ between $U(x)$ and $U(y)$, there is an equivalence $e'$ between $x$ and $y$ such that $U(e')$ is homotopic to $e$.
\end{enumerate}

The first condition holds by \rlem{marked-hom}, but the second one does not usually hold for all marked objects.
We can consider some full $\infty$-subcategory of $\Ho_\infty(\C^m)$ for which it holds.
One way to describe such $\infty$-categories is to take left Bousfield localizations of $\C^m$.
The following proposition gives a sufficient condition for such a localization to be an $\infty$-subcategory of $\Ho_\infty(\C)$:

\begin{prop}[marked-mono]
Let $\C^m_L$ be a left Bousfield localization of $\C^m$ such that, for every pair of fibrant objects $X$ and $Y$ of $\C^m_L$, every weak equivalence $f : U(X) \to U(Y)$ preserves and reflects marked maps.
Then $\Ho_\infty(U) : \Ho_\infty(\C^m_L) \to \Ho_\infty(\C)$ is a monomorphism of $\infty$-categories.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Condition~\eqref{it:mono-hom} is true by \rlem{marked-hom}.
Let us prove that condition~\eqref{it:mono-eq} also holds for $\Ho_\infty(U)$.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be a pair of fibrant objects of $\C^m_L$.
Then every equivalence in $\Ho_\infty(\C)$ between $U(X)$ and $U(Y)$ can be presented as a span $p : Z \to U(X)$, $q : Z \to U(Y)$, where $q$ is a weak equivalence and $p$ is a trivial fibration.
We will say that a map $k : K \to Z$ is marked if $p \circ k$ is marked.
This makes $Z$ into a marked object $Z'$ such that $p$ lifts to a trivial fibration $p' : Z' \to X$.
This implies that $Z$ is a fibrant object in $\C^m_L$.
Now, by the assumption, the map $q : Z \to U(Y)$ preserves and reflects marked maps,
which implies that it lifts to a weak equivalence $q' : Z' \to Y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a set of simplicial sets and let $\mathcal{K} = \{ \Delta^0 * L \mid L \in \mathcal{L} \}$.
It is proved in \cite[Proposition~4.1]{marked-obj} that there is a left Bousfield localization $\sSet_\mathcal{L}$ of the category of $\mathcal{K}$-marked simplicial sets
in which a marked simplicial set $X$ is fibrant if and only if $X$ is a quasicategory and a cone in $X$ is marked if and only if it is a limit cone.
Since an equivalence of quasicategories always preserves and reflects limit cones, the condition of \rprop{marked-mono} holds.
Thus, the $\infty$-category corresponding to this model category is the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories with limits of given shapes and functors preserving them.
In particular, $\sSet_{\{ \varnothing, \Lambda^2_2 \}}$ presents the $\infty$-category of finitely complete $\infty$-categories and functors preserving finite limits.
\end{example}

% TODO: Give a characterization of S-local objects.

It is often convenient to work with categories in which objects have chosen lifts for certain maps.
Let $S$ be a set of maps of a category $\C$.
Then there is a category $\C_S$ with objects $(X,\mathcal{E})$, where $X$ is an object of $\C$ and $\mathcal{E}$ is a function that, for every map $A \to B$ in $S$ and every map $A \to X$ gives a lift in the following diagram:
\[ \xymatrix{ A \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \\
              B \ar@{-->}[ur]
            } \]
Morphisms in $\C_S$ are morphisms of the underlying objects preserving chosen lifts.
We will use the following theorem to construct a left semi-model structure on $\C_S$:

\begin{thm}[alg-fib-obj]
Suppose that $\C$ is a cofibrantly generated left semi-model category in which all cofibrations are monomorphisms.
Let $S$ be a set of trivial cofibrations of $\C$.
Then there is a model structure on $\C_S$ in which a map is a fibration or a weak equivalence if and only if its underlying map is such in $\C$.
The forgetful functor $U : \C_S \to \C$ preserves cofibrations and it is a right Quillen functor and a part of a Quillen equivalence.
If $\C$ is a model category, then so is $\C_S$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
This follows from results of \cite{algebraic-fibrant-objects}.
This theorem differs from \cite[Theorem~2.20]{algebraic-fibrant-objects} in two ways.
First, we do not assume that trivial cofibrations in $S$ determine fibrant objects, but this assumption is superfluous and was never used in \cite{algebraic-fibrant-objects}.
The second difference is that we only assume that $\C$ is a left semi-model category.
To construct a left semi-model structure on $\C_S$, we need to show that maps in $\Icell[F(\J)]$ with cofibrant domains are weak equivalences.
This can be done in the same way as in \cite[Theorem~2.20]{algebraic-fibrant-objects} using the fact that $U$ preserves cofibrant objects (which is true by \cite[Corollary~2.18]{algebraic-fibrant-objects}).
\end{proof}

Let $\C$ be a combinatorial left semi-model category $\C$ in which all cofibrations are monomorphisms.
Let $S$ be a set of cofibrations with cofibrant codomains of $\C$.
We want to construct a left semi-model structure on $\C_S$.
We cannot use \rthm{alg-fib-obj} directly since morphisms in $S$ are not weak equivalences, but we can combine this theorem with \rthm{mark-main} to get the desired result.
Let $\mathcal{F} : S \to \C$ be the codomain function considered as a functor from a discrete category.
Let $\C^m$ be the category of $\mathcal{F}$-marked objects.
We can make $S$ into a set of maps of marked objects in which only the identity maps on the codomains of morphisms in $S$ are marked.
Let $\C^m_L$ be the left Bousfield localization of $\C^m$ at the set $S$.
By \rthm{alg-fib-obj}, there is a left-semi model structure on the category $\C^m_{L,S}$ of marked objects with chosen $S$-lifts such that the forgetful functor $\C^m_{L,S} \to \C^m_L$ is a part of a Quillen equivalence.
We can define a left semi-model structure on $\C_S$ which is Quillen equivalent to $\C^m_{L,S}$:

\begin{thm}
Let $\C$ be a combinatorial left semi-model category $\C$ in which all cofibrations are monomorphisms.
Suppose that there is a set $\I$ of generating cofibrations of $\C$ in which all maps have cofibrant domains.
Let $S$ be a set of cofibrations with cofibrant codomains.
Let $\C^m_L$ be the left Bousfield localization of $\C^m$ at the set $S$.
Then there is a left semi-model structure on $\C_S$ which satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{it:alg-cof} If $F_S : \C \to \C_S$ is the left adjoint of the forgetful functor $U_S : \C_S \to \C$, then $F_S(\I)$ is a set generating cofibrations of $\C_S$.
\item \label{it:alg-we} If $(-)^\flat : \C_S \to \C^m_{L,S}$ be the left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U^m_{L,S} : \C^m_{L,S} \to \C_S$, then a map $f$ of $\C_S$ is a weak equivalence if and only if $f^\flat$ is a weak equivalence.
\item Both adjunctions $F_S \dashv U_S$ and $(-)^\flat \dashv U^m_{L,S}$ are Quillen adjunctions and the latter one is a Quillen equivalence.
\item The left semi-model category $\C_S$ is Quillen equivalent to $\C^m_L$ and this Quillen equivalence commutes with forgetful functors $U_S : \C_S \to C$ and $U^m : \C^m_L \to \C$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Conditions~\eqref{it:alg-cof} and \eqref{it:alg-we} determine cofibrations and weak equivalences of $\C_S$.
We will construct the semi-model structure on $\C_S$ using Smith's theorem.
Since $(-)^\flat : \C_S \to \C^m_{L,S}$ is a left adjoint, most of the conditions of this theorem hold trivially.
We just need to prove that maps in $\Iinj[F_S(\I)]$ are weak equivalences.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a map in $\Iinj[F_S(\I)]$.
Then $U_S(f)$ is a trivial fibration in $\C$.
Thus, we just need to prove that $R^m(f^\flat)$ reflects marked maps.
Let $i : A \to B$ be a map in $S$ and let $k : B \to R(X)$ be a map such that $R(f) \circ k$ is marked in $R^m(Y)$.
Then $R(f) \circ k$ is homotopic to a map of the form $B \xrightarrow{g} Y \to R(Y)$, where $g$ is the chosen lift for $g \circ i$.
Since $B$ is cofibrant and $U_S(f)$ is a trivial fibration, we have a map $g' : B \to X$ such that $U_S(f) \circ g' = g$.
If $g'' : B \to X$ is the chosen lift for $g' \circ i$, then $U_S(f) \circ g'' = g$ since $f$ preserves chosen lifts.
Since $g''$ is marked in $X^\flat$, we just need to show that $B \xrightarrow{g''} X \to R(X)$ is homotopic to $k$.
Since $B$ is cofibrant and $R(f)$ is a weak equivalence between fibrant objects, this follows from the fact that $B \xrightarrow{g''} X \to R(X) \xrightarrow{R(f)} R(Y)$ is homotopic to $R(f) \circ k$.

We have the following commutative (up to isomorphism) square of left adjoint functors:
\[ \xymatrix{ \C \ar[r]^{(-)^\flat} \ar[d]_{F_S} & \C^m_L \ar[d]^{F^m} \\
              \C_S \ar[r]_{(-)^\flat}            & \C^m_{L,S}
            } \]
The functor $F_S$ preserves cofibrations by definition and it preserves trivial cofibrations since $F^m \circ F_S$ preserves them.
The functor $(-)^\flat : C_S \to C^m_{L,S}$ preserves cofibrations since $F^m \circ F_S$ preserves them.
Also, it preserves weak equivalence by definition.
Thus, $F_S \dashv U_S$ and $(-)^\flat \dashv U^m_{L,S}$ are Quillen adjunctions.
Since $(-)^\flat$ preserves and reflects weak equivalences, to prove that the latter adjunction is a Quillen equivalence, it is enough to show that the counit $\varepsilon_X : (U^m_{L,S}(X))^\flat \to X$ is a weak equivalence for every fibrant object $X$.
Since the underlying map of $\varepsilon_X$ is the identity, we just need to prove that $R^m(\varepsilon_X)$ reflects marked maps.
Let $i : A \to B$ be a map in $S$ and let $k : B \to X$ be a marked map.
If $k' : B \to X$ be the chosen lift for the map $k \circ i$, then $k'$ is marked in $(U^m_{L,S}(X))^\flat$.
Since $i$ is a trivial cofibration, $X$ is fibrant, and $k \circ i = k' \circ i$, it follows that $k$ and $k'$ are homotopic.
Thus, $k$ is also marked in $R^m((U^m_{L,S}(X))^\flat)$.

The last property follows from the facts that $(-)^\flat \dashv U^m_{L,S}$ and $F^m \dashv U^m$ are Quillen equivalences and the square of left adjoint functors above commutes.

\section{Finite limits in categories with fibrations}

Let $\C$ be a simplicial category.
An object $1$ of $\C$ is \emph{terminal} if the simplicial set $\Hom(c,1)$ is contractible for every object of $\C$.
If $1$ is a terminal object of $\C$, then it is also a terminal objects of $N(\C)$.
A \emph{product} of objects $a$ and $b$ of $\C$ is an object $a \times b$ together with maps $\pi_1 : \Hom(a \times b, a)$ and $\pi_2 : \Hom(a \times b, b)$ such that the following map is an equivalence for every object $c$:
\[ \Hom(c, a \times b) \to \Hom(c,a) \times \Hom(c,b) \]
If $a \times b$ is a product of $a$ and $b$, then it is a product of these objects in $N(\C)$.
Now, \rprop{over-cat} implies that a pullback of two basic fibrations in $\C$ is a pullback in $N(\C)$.
