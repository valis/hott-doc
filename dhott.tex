\section{Models of indexed type theories}

In this section, we discuss several examples of models of indexed type theories.
Indexed type theories are defined in \cite{indexed-tt} as certain essentially algebraic theory.
Thus, we have a notion of a model of such a theory.
We will call models of indexed unary (resp., dependent) type theories \emph{contextually indexed categories} (resp., \emph{contextually indexed contextual categories}).
A contextually indexed category is a contextual category $B$ together with a category indexed over $B$, that is a functor $B^\fs{op} \to \cat{Cat}$.
A contextually indexed contextual category is a contextual category $B$ together with a contextual category indexed over $B$, that is a functor $B^\fs{op} \to \cat{ConCat}$.

One class of contextually indexed contextual categories was already defined in \cite{indexed-tt}.
An indexed type theory can be interpreted in an appropriate homotopy type theory.
This implies that there is a forgetful functor $U$ from the category of contextual categories to the category of contextually indexed contextual categories.
If $M$ is a contextual category, then $U(M)$ will be called \emph{the canonical indexing of $M$ over itself}.
The underlying contextual category of $U(M)$ is indeed $M$ itself.

Let $F$ be a functor between underlying categories of contextual categories $\scat{B}'$ and $\scat{B}$.
If $\scat{C}$ is a contextual category over $\scat{B}$, then \emph{change of base} of $\scat{C}$ along $F$ is defined as $\scat{C} \circ F^\fs{op}$ and denoted by $F^*(\scat{C})$.
If $F$ and $G$ are isomorphic functors between categories underlying contextual categories $\scat{B}'$ and $\scat{B}$, then $F^*(\scat{C})$ and $G^*(\scat{C})$ are also isomorphic for every contextuall indexed (contextual) category $\scat{C}$.

The intended models of theories that we will be discussing in this paper can be described as full subcategories of the category $\sSet^{\Delta^\fs{op}}$,
where $\sSet$ is the canonical indexing of the category of simplicial set (considered as a contextual category as described in \cite{kap-lum-voe}) over itself.
Our aim here is to define the model $\sSet^{\Delta^\fs{op}}$.
Since it requires little additional effort, we will define more general contextually indexed category $\scat{C}^\scat{J}$ for every appropriate category $\scat{C}$ and category $\scat{J}$.

\subsection{Change of base}

Let $\scat{C}$ be a category with a chosen class of maps, called fibrations, such that the terminal object exists and pullbacks of fibrations exist and are fibrations.
Such categories will be called \emph{categories with fibrations}.
The local universes construction defined in \cite{local-universes}, for every category with fibrations $\scat{C}$,
gives us a contextual category $\scat{C}_!$ whose types over $\Gamma$ are diagrams of the form
\[ \xymatrix{                       & E_A \ar@{->>}[d]^{p_A} \\
              \Gamma \ar[r]_-{r_A}  & V_A
            } \]
where $p_A$ is a fibration.
Terms of this type are sections $\Gamma \to E_A$.
For every type $\Gamma \vdash A$, the extended context $\Gamma, x : A$ is the pullback of this diagram.
If $\scat{C}$ satisfies additional conditions listed in \cite[Definition~4.2.1]{local-universes}, then $\scat{C}_!$ models unit types, identity types, $\Sigma$-types, and $\Pi$-types.

If $\scat{B}$ is a category with fibrations, then the underlying category of $\scat{B}_!$ is equivalent to the category $\scat{B}_f$ of fibration objects of $\scat{B}$.
Thus, change of base for (contextual) categories indexed over $\scat{B}_!$ is defined for every functor $\scat{B}'_f \to \scat{B}_f$.
If $F : \scat{B}' \to \scat{B}$ is a functor that preserves fibrations, terminal objects, and pullbacks of fibrations, then there is an obvious contextual functor between contextual categories $F_! : \scat{B}'_! \to \scat{B}_!$.
The underlying functor of $F_!$ is isomorphic to $F_f : \scat{B}'_f \to \scat{B}_f$, the restriction of $F$ to fibrant objects of $\scat{B}'$.

Let $\scat{B}$ be a contextual category, let $\scat{C}$ be a category with fibrations, and let $F : \scat{B} \to \scat{C}$ be a functor.
We showed above that if the image of $F$ consists of fibrant objects, then we can define change of base $F^*(\scat{C}_!)$.
Actually, we can define this contextual category for arbitrary $F$.
This is a straightforward generalization of the local universes model.
Closed indexed types in context $\Gamma$ are diagrams of the form
\[ \xymatrix{                           & E_A \ar@{->>}[d]^{p_A} \\
              F(\Gamma) \ar[r]_-{r_A}   & V_A
            } \]
where $p_A$ is a fibration.
Contexts, terms, and non-closed types are defined as before.

We are mainly interested in locally small contextually indexed categories since most of the constructions in \cite{indexed-tt} use this property.
In general, local smallness of $\scat{C}$ does not imply local smallness of $F^*(\scat{C})$.
We consider a special case when it does:

\begin{prop}[locally-small]
Let $F : \scat{B} \to \scat{C}$ be a functor between categories with fibrations (which might not preserve any structure).
Suppose that, for every fibration $f : A \to B$ in $\scat{C}$, the pullback functor $f^* : \scat{C}/B \to \scat{C}/A$ has a partial right adjoint $\Pi_f : \scat{C}/A \to \scat{C}/B$, defined for all fibraitons over $A$, and whose values are fibrations over $B$.
Then $F^*(\scat{C}_!)$ has $\Pi$-types.
If $F$ has a right adjoint $G : \scat{C} \to \scat{B}$ which preserves fibrations, then $F^*(\scat{C}_!)$ has dependent $\Hom$-types.
In particular, it is locally small.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The fact that $F^*(\scat{C}_!)$ has $\Pi$-types was proved in \cite{local-universes}.
Since we have $\Pi$-types, it is enough to define dependent $\Hom$-types for closed types:
\begin{center}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma \mid \cdot \vdash B \ob$}
\UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \Hom(\cdot.B) \type$}
\DisplayProof
\qquad
\AxiomC{$\Gamma \mid \cdot \vdash b : B$}
\UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \lambda(b) : \Hom(\cdot.B)$}
\DisplayProof
\qquad
\AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash f : \Hom(\cdot.B)$}
\UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \mid \Delta \vdash f\,() : B$}
\DisplayProof
\end{center}

\begin{align*}
\lambda(b)\,() & = b \\
\lambda(f\,()) & = f
\end{align*}

If $B$ is a closed type, then we define $\Gamma \vdash \Hom(\cdot.B)$ as the following diagram:
\[ \xymatrix{                               & G(E_B) \ar@{->>}[d]^{G(p_B)} \\
              \Gamma \ar[r]_-{\varphi(r_B)} & G(V_B)
            } \]
where $\varphi(r_B)$ is the map corresponding to $r_B$ by adjointness.
A term $\Gamma \mid \cdot \vdash b : B)$ corresponds to a section $b : F(\Gamma) \to E_B$ of $p_B$.
We define $\lambda(b)$ as $\varphi(b) : \Gamma \to G(E_B)$.
Conversely, if $f : \Gamma \to G(E_B)$ is a section of $G(p_B)$, then we define $f\,()$ as $\varphi^{-1}(f) : F(\Gamma) \to E_B$.
The fact that these constructions are stable under substitution follows from the naturality of $\varphi$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Type-theoretic semi-fibration categories}

The notion of a type-theoretic fibration category was defined in \cite[Definition~2.1]{shul-inv}.
We define a generalization of this notion:
\begin{defn}
A \emph{type-theoretic semi-fibration category} consists of a category $\scat{C}$ with a chosen class of maps, called fibrations, a chosen terminal object, and chosen pullbacks of fibrations such that the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every fibration $f : A \to B$, the pullback functor $f^* : \scat{C}/B \to \scat{C}/A$ has a partial right adjoint $\Pi_f : \scat{C}/A \to \scat{C}/B$, defined for all fibraitons over $A$.
\item The class of fibrations contains all isomorphisms and is closed under compositions and pullbacks.
\item Let $f : A \to B$ be a trivial cofibration (that is, a map with the left lifting property with respect to fibrations) that fits in the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{ A \ar[rr]^f \ar@{->>}[dr] &   & B \ar@{->>}[dl] \\
                                        & C
            } \]
where $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ are fibrations. Then pullbacks of $f$ along fibrations are trivial cofibrations.
\item Let $f : A \to B$ be a map that fits in the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{ A \ar[rr]^f \ar@{->>}[dr] &   & B \ar@{->>}[dl] \\
                                        & C
            } \]
where $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ are fibrations. Then $f$ factors as a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration.
\item Let $f : A \to B$ be a trivial cofibration that fits in the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{ A \ar[rr]^f \ar@{->>}[dr] &   & B \ar@{->>}[dl] \\
                                        & C
            } \]
where $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ are fibrations. Then, for every map $r : D \to C$, the pullback map $r^*(A) \to r^*(B)$ is a trivial cofibration.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

The first condition is a technical assumption required by the local universes construction.
The second condition implies the existence of $\Sigma$-types and unit types.
The third condition is a technical assumption that guarantees that the category is homotopically well-behaved.
The last two conditions imply the existence of identity types.
We will say that a type-theoretic semi-fibration category is \emph{right proper} if $\Pi_f$ preserves fibrations (equivalently, if trivial cofibrations are stable under pullbacks along fibrations).
We will say that a type-theoretic semi-fibration category is \emph{extensional} if $\Pi_f$ preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations (that is, fibrations which are also homotopy equivalences).

\begin{remark}
A type-theoretic fibration category is precisely a type-theoretic semi-fibration category in which all objects are fibrant.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[semi-fib]
The full subcategory of a type-theoretic semi-fibration category on fibrant objects is a type-theoretic fibration category.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[semi-over]
Slice categories of a type-theoretic semi-fibration category are also type-theoretic semi-fibration categories.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
Let $\scat{M}$ be a model category in which cofibrations are stable under pullbacks and such that the pullback functor $g^* : \scat{M}/B \to \scat{M}/A$ has a right adjoint $\Pi_g$ for every fibration $g : A \to B$.
Then $\scat{M}$ is a type-theoretic semi-fibration category.
We will call such a model category \emph{type-theoretic model category}.
This is a slightly more general notion than the one defined in \cite[Definition~2.12]{shul-inv}.

A type-theoretic model category is right proper as a type-theoretic semi-fibration category if and only if it is right proper as a model category.
If trivial fibrations in a type-theoretic model category $\scat{M}$ are homotopy equivalences, then $\scat{M}$ is extensional.
In particular, every right proper locally Cartesian closed model category in which cofibrations are precisely monomorphisms is an extensional type-theoretic semi-fibration category.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If $\scat{M}$ is a type-theoretic model category and $\scat{J}$ is a small category, then $\scat{M}^\scat{J}$ with the injective model structure (if it exists) is a type-theoretic model category.
Trivial cofibrations in $\scat{M}$ are stable under pullbacks since they are precisely objectwise trivial cofibrations.
The right adjoint to pullback functors exists by \cite[Theorem~2.12]{comp-fact-tor}.
If $\scat{M}$ is right proper and all objects of $\scat{M}$ are cofibrant, then $\scat{M}^\scat{J}$ is extensional.
\end{example}

\begin{defn}
A \emph{Quillen adjunction} between type-theoretic semi-fibration categories is an adjunction such that the right adjoint preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations.
If $F \dashv G$ is a Quillen adjunction, then $F$ (resp., $G$) will be called \emph{left (resp., right) Quillen functor}.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[indexed-locally-small]
Let $F$ be a left Quillen functor between type-theoretic semi-fibration categories $\scat{B}$ and $\scat{C}$.
Then $F^*(\scat{C}_!)$ is a contextually indexed contextual category with unit types, $\Sigma$-types, and identity types.
If $\scat{C}$ is right proper, then $F^*(\scat{C}_!)$ has $\Pi$-types and dependent $\Hom$-types.
In particular, it is locally small.
If $\scat{C}$ is extensional, then $\Pi$-types and identity types are extensional.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The existence of unit types, $\Sigma$-types, identity types, and $\Pi$-types follows from \cite{local-universes}.
The existence of dependent $\Hom$-types is proved in \rprop{locally-small}.
The functional extensionality holds by \cite[Lemma~5.9]{shul-inv}.
Thus, we just need to prove that identity types are extensional.

We need to prove that the canonical function
\[ \Id_{\Hom(\Delta.B)}(f,g) \to \Hom(\Delta.\,\Id_B(f\,\overline{x},g\,\overline{x})) \] is an equivalence, where $\Delta = x_1 : A_1, \ldots x_n : A_n$.
Since we have $\Pi$-types this function is equivalent to the canonical function $\Id_{\Hom(\cdot . \Pi(\Delta,B))(\lambda(\lambda \overline{x}.f\overline{x}),\lambda(\lambda \overline {x}.g\overline{x}))} \to \Hom(\cdot . \Pi(\Delta, \Id(f\,\overline{x},g\,\overline{x})))$.
This function factors through the canonical function $\Hom(\cdot . \Id_{\Pi(\Delta,B)}(\lambda \overline{x}. f\,\overline{x}, \lambda \overline{x}. g\,\overline{x})) \to \Hom(\cdot . \Pi(\Delta, \Id(f\,\overline{x},g\,\overline{x})))$.
Since $\Pi$-types are extensional, we just need to show that the map $\Id_{\Hom(\cdot . \Pi(\Delta,B))(\lambda(\lambda \overline{x}.f\overline{x}),\lambda(\lambda \overline {x}.g\overline{x}))} \to \Hom(\cdot . \Id_{\Pi(\Delta,B)}(\lambda \overline{x}. f\,\overline{x}, \lambda \overline{x}. g\,\overline{x}))$ is an equivalence.
We prove that, more generally, for every closed type $A$ and terms $\Gamma \vdash a : \Hom(\cdot.A)$ and $\Gamma \vdash a' : \Hom(\cdot.A)$, the canonical function $\Id_{\Hom(\cdot . A)}(a,a') \to \Hom(\cdot . \Id_A(a\,(),a'\,()))$ is an equivalence.
This function will be denoted by $\fs{hap}_A$.

The type $A$ correspond to a diagram of the form
\[ \xymatrix{                           & E_A \ar@{->>}[d]^{p_A} \\
              F(\Gamma) \ar[r]_-{r_A}   & V_A
            } \]
and terms $a$ and $a'$ correspond to section $a,a' : F(\Gamma) \to E_A$ of $p_A$.
Types $\Id_{\Hom(\cdot . A)}(a,a')$ and $\Hom(\cdot . \Id_A(a\,(),a'\,()))$ are interpreted as the following diagrams:
\[ \xymatrix{                                                           & & P_{G(V_A)}(G(E_A)) \ar@{->>}[d]^q \\
              \Gamma \ar[rr]_-{\langle \varphi(a), \varphi(a') \rangle} & & G(E_A) \times_{G(V_A)} G(E_A)
            } \qquad
   \xymatrix{                                                   & & G(P_{V_A}(E_A)) \ar@{->>}[d]^{G(q')} \\
              \Gamma \ar[rr]_-{\varphi(\langle a, a' \rangle)}  & & G(E_A \times_{V_A} E_A)
            } \]
where $P_{X}(Y)$ is the path object for the diagonal $Y \to Y \times_{X} Y$.
Since the map $G(E_A) \to P_{G(V_A)}(G(E_A))$ is a trivial cofiration, we have a lift in the following diagram:
\[ \xymatrix{ G(E_A) \ar[d]_r \ar[rr]^-{G(r')}                      &                                               & G(P_{V_A}(E_A)) \ar@{->>}[d]^{G(q')} \\
              P_{G(V_A)}(G(E_A)) \ar@{->>}[r]_-q \ar@{-->}[urr]^s   & G(E_A) \times_{G(V_A)} G(E_A) \ar[r]_-\simeq  & G(E_A \times_{V_A} E_A)
            } \]
This lift is the interpretation of $\fs{hap}_A$.
To prove that the pullback of $s$ over $\Gamma$ is an equivalence which is stable under pullbacks, it is enough to show that $s$ is an equivalence.

There is a fibration $G(E_A \times_{V_A} E_A) \to G(E_A)$.
Moreover, the induced maps $X \to G(E_A)$ for every object in the diagram above are also fibrations.
By \rremark{semi-fib} and \rremark{semi-over}, we can think of this diagram as a diagram in the type-theoretic fibration category of fibrations over $G(E_A)$.
Since $r$ is trivial cofibration, \cite[Lemma~3.6]{shul-inv} implies that it is an equivalence.
The map $r'$ is also an equivalence for the same reasons.
By the 2-out-of-3 property, the map $P_{V_A}(E_A) \to E_A$ is a trivial fibration.
Since $G$ preserves trivial fibrations, the 2-out-of-3 property implies that $G(r')$ is an equivalence.
Finally, by the 2-out-of-3 property, $s$ is an equivalence.
\end{proof}

% Now, we are ready to describe our main example of a contextually indexed contextual category:

\begin{example}
If $\scat{M}$ is a type-theoretic model category and $\scat{J}$ is a small category, then the diagonal functor $\scat{M} \to \scat{M}^\scat{J}$ satisfies the conditions of \rprop{indexed-locally-small}.
If $\scat{M}$ is right proper and all objects of $\scat{M}$ are cofibrant, then this is also true for $\scat{M}^\scat{J}$, which implies that it is extensional.
% In particular, this is true for the diagonal functor $\sSet \to \sSet^{\Delta^\fs{op}}$.
\end{example}
